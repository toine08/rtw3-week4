# NFT WATCHER

## A bit of background

This site was made as part of the roadtoweb3 programme created by alchemy.

The goal of this week was to create an NFT watcher in wallet or to be able to see a whole collection.

## What technologies I used ?

For this project, I used [Nextjs](http://nextjs.com), as well as [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling but also [alchemy](http://alchemy.com/nft-api) API to be able to have access to the data to display the NFTs.

The site was finished and deployed thanks to [Vercel](http://vercel.com). You can access it here: [https://nft-watcher.vercel.app](https://nft-watcher.vercel.app/)

## Difficulties

The biggest difficulty was choosing colours to match (I'm still not happy with it but it's what I like most). The styling with tailwind, I had some difficulty making it work but their documentation is rich and very nice to read.

## Clone my project

if you want to take over my project you can do these steps

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/toine08/rtw3-week4.git
