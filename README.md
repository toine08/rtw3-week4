Really simple actually, just had your wallet address on the Input and you will be able to see all our NFTs from ethereum mainnet.

If you want to see all the NFTs from a collections you can copy the address collection and click on fetch for collection and past the collection address on the input.

That is it, no connection needed!

## A bit of background

This site was made as part of the roadtoweb3 programme created by alchemy.

The goal of this week was to create an NFT watcher in wallet or to be able to see a whole collection.

## What technologies I used ?

For this project, I used [Nextjs](http://nextjs.com), as well as [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling but also [alchemy](http://alchemy.com/nft-api) API to be able to have access to the data to display the NFTs.

The site was finished and deployed thanks to [Vercel](http://vercel.com). You can access it here: [https://nft-watcher.vercel.app](https://nft-watcher.vercel.app/)

## Difficulties

The biggest difficulty was choosing colours to match (I'm still not happy with it but it's what I like most). The styling with tailwind, I had some difficulty making it work but their documentation is rich and very nice to read.

## Clone my project
